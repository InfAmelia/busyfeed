== README

As of now, rake db:seed is all of the setup required to see populated titles.

=== REQUESTING FRESH TITLES

buzz.feed_me => an array of titles (still wrapped in xml tags)

=== TURNING A FRESH TITLE INTO A TEMPLATE

TBD.

=== GENERATING NEW TITLES FROM EXISTING TEMPLATES

Title.all.map {|t| t.parse_phrase } # This should probably be re-named 'generate'-phrase.
